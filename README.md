# lolelffs

`loleffs` is a filesystem based on simplefs that is compliant with the ELF
specification. This means that a `lolelffs` enabled binary can also work as a
filesystem with the `lolelffs` kernel module loaded. To enable `lolelffs` on
a elf file use the `mkfs.lolelffs` program to create compatable ELF file.
